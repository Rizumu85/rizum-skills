# Rizum Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to ensure structured planning, living documentation, and clear communication. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Activation:** Use this skill only when the user explicitly invokes `rizum-guidelines`, `/rizum-guidelines`, or asks to use Rizum Guidelines. Do not activate it automatically for general coding tasks.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward deliberate planning and continuous documentation over immediate, undocumented coding.

## 1. Mandatory Documentation

**Always ground your work in explicit analysis, design, and planning.**

- **Purpose:** This explicit documentation externalizes the thought process and current state, allowing any other AI agents or human collaborators to quickly catch up, align with the project context, and resume work seamlessly without losing the architectural thread.
- Create and maintain three specific files in the project directory before executing tasks: `analysis.md`, `design.md`, and `plan.md`.
- `analysis.md`: Focuses on understanding the problem, edge cases, and constraints.
- `design.md`: Focuses on architectural choices, system structure, API contracts, or UI/UX patterns.
- Do not begin writing project code until the foundation in these three documents is established.

## 2. Connected, Testable Planning

**Bridge the gap between theory and execution with actionable steps.**

- Ensure `plan.md` directly references and connects to the context established in both `analysis.md` and `design.md`.
- Break down the plan into sequential steps using To-Do checklists, such as `- [ ]`.
- Size your steps appropriately: they must be small enough to be independently testable and verifiable, but not so micro-granular that they clutter the plan.

## 3. Living Documents

**Keep your documentation perfectly synced with reality.**

- Actively update the To-Do list in `plan.md`, such as `- [x]`, every time a step is completed.
- Treat your documentation as agile. If working feedback, bugs, or new discoveries cause the actual implementation to shift, stop and update `analysis.md`, `design.md`, and `plan.md` to reflect the new direction.
- Never let the code drift away from the documentation.

## 4. Execution and Testing Constraints

**Delegate full testing to the user. Limit self-verification to syntax.**

- Do not attempt to run full project compilations or execute comprehensive test suites.
- Leave functional testing and end-to-end verification to the user.
- If you need to verify code correctness during implementation, restrict your checks strictly to basic syntax validation and static error checking.

## 5. Bilingual Communication Protocol

**Summarize in Chinese, document in English.**

- Write all project files, code, comments, `analysis.md`, `design.md`, `plan.md`, and technical documentation strictly in English.
- When outputting the summary of your changes in the chat interface, write the summary in Chinese.
- Keep all other parts of the chat response in English where appropriate.

These guidelines are working if the project directory always contains up-to-date `analysis.md`, `design.md`, and `plan.md` files; context is easily transferable between agents; execution matches the checked-off steps; full testing is safely delegated to the user; documentation shifts dynamically with implementation changes; and chat change summaries are consistently delivered in Chinese.
